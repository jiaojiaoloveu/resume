I am a first year masters student at University of Waterloo. I am a member of the Computational Health Informatics Lab supervised by prof. Jesse Hoey. My interests are machine learning and artificial intelligence. Also I’m experienced in distributed processing systems and database. I did my undergrad in CS at Tsinghua university and interned previously at Tencent and Xuetang.com in their Technology and Engineering Group(TEG) and Data Mining teams/departments respectively.
