      \begin{cvitems}
        \item{It's valuable to know if the actor is human or service so that AWS Macie could set anomaly alert threshold accordingly. Given batches of aggregated logs, this project was consisted of three phases: labelling raw data, trainning ML models and classifying future incoming data.}
        \item{{\bf Hive} and {\bf Presto} were used to establish database and do data transformation, and {\bf Apache Zeppelin} was used to do data visualization and interacted queries. Applied several machine learning models including RF, GBT, MLP and SVM in Spark ML library and compared models regarding to accuracy, efficiency and scalability. It turned out both RF and GBT hit the best performance with an accuracy more than 95\% and a latency less than 1 second.}
        \item{The classification results could be output to Macie Elasticsearch component for further use.}

      \begin{cvitems}
          \item{
              Trained a {\bf convolutional neural network} using CIFAR-10 dataset on large-scale data processing systems and generated artistic style images from daily photos with extracted content/style features at low time costs.
          }
          \item{
              Constructed the neural network with {\bf TensorFlow} and processed on {\bf Spark}. Compared the two distributed data processing systems, mainly on computation efficiency, dataset scalability and fault tollerance.
