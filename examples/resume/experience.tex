      \begin{cvitems}
          \item{
              Trained a {\bf convolutional neural network} on large-scale data processing systems and generated artistic style images with extracted content/style features.
          }
          \item{
              Constructed the neural network with {\bf TensorFlow} and processed on {\bf Spark} or {\bf PowerGraph}. Compared the two distributed data processing systems, mainly on computation efficiency, dataset scalability and fault tollerance.
